                        Voluntary Contributions (VC) refers to additional contributions you can decide to include to your mandatory pension contributions for the purpose of augmenting them or simply to set aside as savings towards a goal. VC is an optional contribution made above the mandatory 18% employer and employee contributions into an individual’s Retirement Savings Account (RSA). You could access your VC subject to the extant rules on withdrawal released by PenCom.
