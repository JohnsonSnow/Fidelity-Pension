                        The Pension Reform Act, 2004 (the Act) provided that contributions into the NSITF scheme (the Scheme) together with accrued income shall be transferred into members. Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs) after the expiration of the 5 years moratorium i.e. from July, 2009. The Act also provided that the Commission should supervise the transfer.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This means that the Pension Reform Act 2014 allows all contributors that have balances from contributions under the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) Act to transfer their balance to their new Retirement Savings Account (RSA) residing with a Pension Fund Administrator.
                        <br />
