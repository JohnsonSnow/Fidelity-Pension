                    <h5>
                        The Multi-Fund Investment Structure (MFIS) is an innovation by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) that provides a framework enabling pension contributors to have a guided say in the choice of the nature of investment assets which their contributions can be invested in. From inception in 2005, contributors have always been grouped into two, namely, the RSA Fund for active contributors and the Retiree Fund for those who have retired from active service. The essential difference between the two Funds was that the RSA Fund was allowed to have a higher content of risky assets than the Retiree Fund. The risk content has to do with the percentage of assets in the portfolio with variable incomes. It is generally believed that the higher the risk in an asset class, the higher the income. On this premise, the argument has been that while some people prefer higher risks so as to predispose them to higher income, there are different levels of risk preference or appetite for different people. Some people therefore felt that restricting contributors to the above two categories was not fair enough, prompting PenCom to think of ways of increasing the number of Funds to accommodate more shades of contributors.
                        <br />
                        In line with the above thinking, PenCom has created four different Funds, namely, Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and Fund IV and PFAs are required to transfer, in accordance with the guidelines, contributors in the previous two groups into the newly created four Funds, effective July 1, 2018. The existing RSA (Active) Fund is now to be replaced with Funds I – III, while the Retiree Fund now becomes Fund IV.

                                        Every active worker looks forward to having a restful retirement time when he/she will fall back on his/her RSA balance for periodic pension payments from the PFA. Such payments are expected to be stable over the retiree’s expected life span. The whole essence of pension is to ensure that the retiree gets his or her benefits as and when due. Risk is the probability that an adverse situation will occur with respect to the object in question. A typical adverse situation in pension benefit payment is that funds are not available to meet the payments as and when due. If that happens, then the whole purpose of pension is defeated. For this reason, anything that will jeopardize the chances of a pensioner getting his benefits on retirement is a source of risk. It is therefore necessary to consider how close to retirement age a contributor is, in deciding the level of risk to expose the contributor’s RSA balance to. This is why, as far as PenCom is concerned, the risk tolerance level should decrease as one approaches the retirement age.

                                        Variable income instruments are investments that generate returns that cannot be pre-determined from the date the investments were made. The returns on the investments vary from day to day, making the investment values volatile. It is this volatility that introduces the risk element to the investment. For example, quoted shares in the stock market are classified as variable income assets because the price may rise or fall tomorrow; no one is sure. But a bank deposit is classified as a fixed income asset because from the commencement date, the interest rate and tenor (e.g. 12% p.a. for 90 days) are known. Variable income instruments include Ordinary shares, Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) such as Mutual Funds, Private Equity Funds, Infrastructure funds, Real Estate Investment Trust.

                                        The multi-fund structure provides more alignment between your retirement goals, risk appetite and age. At a young age, you can afford to take high risks with your contributions which may result in immediate high or low returns. At that age, any immediate loss could be recouped in the course of time, because your retirement age is still far ahead. However, if a contributor is close to retirement age and chooses a high risk Fund, which returns an immediate loss, there may not be enough time to recover the loss before the retirement age crystallizes. So, as one approaches retirement age, one’s account is domiciled in a Fund type with a lower risk profile, where there is a higher probability that the balance to be moved to the Retiree Fund (IV) on retirement would have attained a relatively stable status.
