                        Fidelity Pension Managers Limited’s (“Fidelity Pension” or “the Company”) Corporate Governance framework is designed to promote the smooth running of the operations of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Reform Act 2014 (PRA 2014), Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2004, the Code of Corporate Governance for Licensed Pension Operators, 2008 (“the Code”), the various Guidelines/Circulars issued by the National Pension Commission (“the Commission” or “PenCom”), any other regulatory or statutory provisions in the Federal Republic of Nigeria as well as globally accepted best practices on governance and ethics.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        At Fidelity Pension, we understand that the strength of any robust governance structure starts from the top, with a reputable chairman leading a board composed of independent, well-informed directors, who give priority to strategic planning, ensure that standards exist to promote ethical behaviour throughout the organization, and seek continuous improvement in governance practices.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These strengths are fundamental to sustaining the Company’s success, preserving and increasing shareholder value. Consequently, they are fostered throughout the organization by a proactive governance culture that has consistently adopted industry-leading standards thereby ensuring compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements.

                        <br />

                        The Company has also developed an internal Code of Corporate Governance which provides a framework for effective governance of the Board and the Company. The Company’s Code of Corporate Governance is continuously revised to align with legal and regulatory requirements and global best practices as they evolve.  The internal Code details the Company’s adopted policies and procedures and sets out the roles and delegated authorities applying to the Board, Board Committees, and the Management Committees respectively.
